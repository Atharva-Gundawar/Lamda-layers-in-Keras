The Lambda layer exists so that arbitrary expressions can be used as a Layer when constructing Sequential and Functional API models. Lambda layers are best suited for simple operations or quick experimentation. In this colab ill be implimenting keras's Lambda layer which will also cover custom activation functions and tf.keras.layers.add layer.
